        <h3>What is RESTful API ?</h3>
        <p>REST APIs, or RESTful APIs as they're commonly called, are one of the most prevalent types of API. REST or RESTful APIs have numerous advantages because they are designed to take advantage of existing protocols. While REST - or Representational
            State Transfer - can be utilized across practically any protocol, it is most commonly employed for web APIs. This means that when developing a REST API, developers do not need to install any additional software or libraries.</p>
        <h2>On Time Delivery API with Node js and Express</h2>
        </a>
        <p>Using this REST API, you can create, read, update, and delete a parcel by its id, or get and delete all courses. To simplify the example, I used an array to store the parcel objects.
            <p>This API has seven methods:
                <ul>
                    <li>Get all parcels</li>
                    <li>Get a user parcel by id</li>
                    <li>Add a new parcel</li>
                    <li>Update a parcel by id</li>
                    <li>Delete a parcel by id</li>
                    <li>User sign up or authorization by post method</li>
                    <li>User logs in also by post method</li>
                </ul>

            <h2><a href="/api-docs">My Swagger API Documentaion</a></h2>
            <p>I used Swagger to document the example REST API. swagger.jsdoc is the document file. (YMAL is also a popular language used to write Swagger Document for REST API documentation).</p>
            <p>The advantage of using Swagger to document REST API is that it provides a dynamic document with "Try it out" buttons. Developers can click the "Try it out" buttons to see how the API works.</P>
            <P>Writing a Swagger API specification file to define an API before starting to code is a good workflow for creating REST API and its document.</P>
            <h2>Interactive REST API Documentation</h2>
            <P>The module "swagger-ui-express" is included in the server.js file, so the swagger API interactive documentation can be automatically created. <br>
